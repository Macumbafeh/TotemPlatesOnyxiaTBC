## Partyicons feature

i added also a party icons feature which display the class icon of your party members with HD and rounded icons. Inspired by the Evolve UI and ArenaPlates addon from Schaka.

This version works everywhere, in arena, in raid, in bg ....

It can be usefull in arena to show easily where your mate is, and also in raid to see where your party members are to use a party item/spell like Bloodlust.

You can enable/disable this feature with a slash command :
`/totemplates partyicons` or `/tm partyicons`
